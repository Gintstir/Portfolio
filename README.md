#  **Portfolio Site/Weekly-Challenge-2**

This is the second weekly challenge for the UPENN LPS Coding bootcamp.  The project required us to make a portfolio site from scratch that can be used in the future to exhibit our work/resume.

## **Motivation**
This was the first time building a site from the ground up.  The assignment proved to be very daunting and difficult but provided ample opportunities to learn and grow as a novice web developer.  I look forward to revisiting this project in the future in order to make many improvements as I acquire new skills.  

## **Build Status**

This is __very__ __much__ a work in progress.  


## **Code Style**

This project used basic HTML with some slightly more advanced CSS elements such as CSS Grid, flexbox, transition, and, animation.
